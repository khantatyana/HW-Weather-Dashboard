Plan to build the Weather Dashboard:

1. Get an API, Set working URL;
2. Put Font icon of weather;
3. Retrieve user's input and convert to variables;
4. User variables to run AJAX call to Weather website, create function to take the user's input city and display current weather of chosen city and forecast for the next 3-5 days;
5. Break down the Weather Object into useable fields;
6. Dynamically generate HTML content;
7. Dealing with "edge cases" - bugs;
8. Attach screenshot;
9. Create list of default cities;
10. When user clicks the city in the history list, he gets the current forecast for that city.
